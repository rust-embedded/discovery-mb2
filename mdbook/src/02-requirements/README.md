# Hardware/knowledge requirements

The primary knowledge requirement to read this book is to know *some* Rust. It's hard for me to
quantify *some*. Being familiar with the basics of generics and traits is quite helpful. You do need
to know how to *use* closures. You also need to be familiar with the idioms of the current Rust
[edition].

Also, to follow this material you'll need:

- A [Micro:Bit v2] (MB2) board.

  [micro:bit v2]: https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/

  You can purchase this board from many suppliers, including
  Amazon and Ali Baba. You can get a [list][0] of suppliers
  directly from the BBC, the manufacturers of MB2.

  There are several versions of the `V2` board
  available. While the material here was written for `V2.00`,
  things should work fine with with any `V2` board.

- A micro-B USB cable (nothing special â€” you probably have many of these). This is required
  to power the micro:bit board when not on battery, and to communicate with it.  Make sure
  that the cable supports data transfer, as some cables only support charging devices.

  > **NOTE** Some micro:bit kits ship with such cables.  USB cables used with other mobile
  > devices should work, if they are micro-B and have the capability to transmit data.

  The official `micro:bit Go` kit provides both the USB cable and a nifty battery pack for powering
  the MB2 without USB.

> **FAQ**: Wait, why do I need this specific hardware?

It makes my life and yours much easier.

The material is much, much more approachable if we don't have to worry about hardware differences.
Trust me on this one.

> **FAQ**: Can I follow this material with a different development board?

Maybe? It depends mainly on two things: your previous experience with microcontrollers and/or
whether a high level crate already exists for your development board somewhere. You probably want at
least a HAL crate, like [`nrf52833-hal`] used here.  You may prefer a board with a Board Support crate,
like [`microbit-v2`] used here.  If you intend to use a different microcontroller, you can look
through [Awesome Embedded Rust] or just search the web to find supported crates.

With a different development board, this text loses most if not all its beginner friendliness and
"easy to follow"-ness, in my opinion: you have been warned.

If you have a different Arm-based development board and you don't consider yourself a total
beginner, you might consider starting with the [quickstart] project template.
